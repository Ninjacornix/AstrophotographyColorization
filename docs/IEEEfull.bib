abstract = {A comprehensive mathematical model to account for colour constancy is formulated. Since the visual system is able to measure true object colour in complex scenes under a broad range of spectral compositions, for the illumination; it is assumed that the visual system must implicitly estimate and illuminant. The basic hypothesis is that the estimate of the illuminant is made on the basis of spatial information from the entire visual field. This estimate is then used by the visual system to arrive at an estimate of the (object) reflectance of the various subfields in the complex visual scene. The estimates are made by matching the inputs to the system to linear combinations of fixed bases and standards in the colour space. The model provides a general unified mathematical framework for related psychophysical phenomenology.}

abstract={Color constancy is the skill by which it is possible to tell the color of an object even under a colored light. I interpret the color of an object as its color under a fixed canonical light, rather than as a surface reflectance function. This leads to an analysis that shows two distinct sets of circumstances under which color constancy is possible. In this framework, color constancy requires estimating the illuminant under which the image was taken. The estimate is then used to choose one of a set of linear maps, which is applied to the image to yield a color descriptor at each point. This set of maps is computed in advance.},
